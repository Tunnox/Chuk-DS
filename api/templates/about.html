  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Hello, I’m <strong>Chukwuemeka Umunna</strong> — though most people call me <strong>Chuk</strong>. I’m an early-career 
    <strong>Data Steward</strong> based in the United Kingdom, with a background in <strong>Applied Geology (BTech)</strong> 
    and a <strong>Master’s degree in GIS</strong>. I’m passionate about supporting a world where data is not only available 
    but also trustworthy, accessible, and ready to support meaningful insights.
  </p>

  <p>
    My journey into data stewardship began when I noticed how valuable research, especially in the geosciences, was often 
    held back by inconsistent or inaccessible data. That experience shaped my dedication to data governance, metadata quality, 
    and the principles of <strong>FAIR</strong> and <strong>TRUST</strong> data. Today, I focus on strengthening data maturity, improve governance, and build systems that allow people to use data with confidence.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would describe myself as disciplined, determined, and hard-working. These qualities guided me through my academic journey 
    and continue to fuel my growth as a professional. I enjoy contributing to projects that create long-term improvements in 
    data quality. I’m constantly expanding my skill set across areas such as data management planning, data privacy, database 
    management, quality assessment, analytics, and programming.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside my professional world, I find joy in cooking, especially experimenting with dishes I’ve never made before. Cooking 
    mirrors the qualities needed in good data stewardship: creativity, patience, and close attention to detail. It’s also where 
    I reset my mind, spark fresh ideas, and recharge my problem-solving energy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m naturally curious and resourceful. Once, during a geological field exploration, I got lost in rugged terrain after my map 
    was destroyed and all my devices stopped working. I relied solely on my <strong>geological intuition</strong> to navigate my 
    way out, an experience that strengthened my calmness, resilience, and analytical thinking. Those qualities still guide me 
    today.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is simple: to make data easier to trust, easier to use, and easier to understand. If my work helps researchers, analysts, 
    and decision-makers focus more on innovation and less on data issues, then I’ve made a meaningful contribution.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’d love to connect, collaborate, or share ideas with you.
